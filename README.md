## What is InstaSee?
InstaSee is small Google Chrome plugin that lets you open in new tab images and videos from Instagram by right clicking on them and select "open in new tab" from the right-click menu. Simple as that! The images ( or videos ) will open in bigger size and better resolution. You can view or save them as regular images.

## How to use it?
First, install the plugin from Chrome Store, or by clicking the fat blue button on the top of the page. Then go to Instagram and just right click on any image and then choose "Open in new tab" from the context menu. If you want to open a video, you have to first start playing it, and then open it in new tab.

## Is it better than other Instagram downloaders?

It is! It is free and opensource ( code available at GitHub ), so everyone can check on it. The plugin works only on instagram.com page, does not collect, track or save any information and does not communicate with servers. I do not compromise on privacy. Also, it is future proof, due to the unique way it works.
